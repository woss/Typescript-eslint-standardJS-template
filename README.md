# Typescript + eslint + standardJS template

WIP and POC for finally solving the nightmare of using TS + eslint + standardJS with VSCode

The goal is to use this template for new projects (react, server or lib) without spending hours setting up the linters and fixers

## Install

```sh
# instal deps
yarn

# check that everything is ok

yarn std
```

## TODO list

- [ ] git hooks
- [ ] build flow
- [ ] tests
- [ ] webpack
